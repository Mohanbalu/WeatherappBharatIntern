- **Real-time Weather Data**: Displays live weather updates, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for quick access to weather information.

## Prerequisites

- Java (JDK) installed on your system.
- API Key from a weather service provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack, etc.).
- Google Development tools integrated for API usage.

## Files and Directory Structure

- **Main Files**:
  - `WeatherApp.java`: Main class where the logic of fetching weather data is implemented.
  - `WeatherService.java`: Service class responsible for connecting to the weather API.
  - `CitySearch.java`: Class to handle city search input from the user.
